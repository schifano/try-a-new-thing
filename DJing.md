### Listening to mixes
A great way to gain inspiration and learn mixing techniques is to listen to mixes. There are lots of ways you can you to listen and discover mixes:

* [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/)
* [MixCloud](https://www.mixcloud.com)
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=DJ+Set)
* [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7HXnQUEKHiWvUqSIR9ydOC) (sometimes)

Who are some of your [favorite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dSgTOI6BTY) artists? Consider [searching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjHf2ckHkeo) for live [recordings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO1UlT9mPRI) of their [mixes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqbsWgQVSko). Listen to their mixing style and consider the different elements of the mix. How long is each song? Are they doing long and gradual transitions or sudden drops to new songs? Are they changing frequency levels (highs, mids, lows)? Maybe they use a lot of loops or scratching techniques. Did they add any sound effects or samples (pre-recorded sound clips)? Could they be using a crossfader? If the mix has video you might even note what kind of hardware is being used. Is it a [DJ controller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOlBLMbASA0) or [launchpad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTx3G6h2xyA)? Maybe they are only using [Pioneer CDJs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy-k0FopsmY) (often they are).

As you consider these traits, also note the context. The context of the set tends to affect the mix itself. What is the duration of the mix? What is the audience size? Where is the set located? At parties or [festivals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2VmcuOEqEg) one might see shorter 60 minute mixes with songs playing for 15-90 seconds at a time. At a nightclub or [underground venue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zstGpA-UMFY) they might see 120+ minute mixes where songs could range from 2-5 minutes at a time.

Listening to mixes is an excellent way to discover new music to purchase. You'll need a high quality full version of each song you wish to use. You will need to download a lot of music and organize it in a system that works best for you. These systems tend to be unique to each DJ based on music and mixing styles as well as personal preference. DJing is a form of art and expression so don't be afraid to create your own way of doing things. If it works, it works.

> Did you know? Some DJs can play for an entire night (~8 hours). Even [12+ hour sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2RT-McQvo0) are not unheard of!

### Jumping in!
When you decide to finally jump in, tutorials and manuals will be your friend. Sometimes it's easier to see and hear someone DJ at the same time. It's recommended that you watch videos explaining DJ techniques so you can see what sounds are produced by manipulating the different parts of the hardware/software. Don't be embarassed to re-create transitions or mixes that you've heard in mixes before.
