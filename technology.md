#### Stats

* 12,000 women in tech (last October 2015)
* 200+ companies recruiting
* Speakers, workshops, networking, company after parties

### Square College Code Camp

> Win a trip to our San Francisco headquarters to participate in a five-day immersion program, where you‘ll attend coding workshops and leadership sessions, participate in a hackathon, and tour San Francisco—all while surrounded by women engineers from across the U.S. and Canada.

[About Square College Code Camp](https://squareup.com/code-camp/college)

**Eligibility**

* Enrolled as a full-time student at a U.S. or Canadian University.
* Pursuing a degree in computer science, computer engineering, or a related technical major.
* A woman who is 18 years or older.

#### Rachel's Testimonial
When I went, it connected me to tons of women like me to lean on as friends and a professional network. We met Jack Dorsey and got to ask him questions, did machine learning/security workshops, participated in hackathons that applied our skills to helping a non-profit organization that pulls children out of poverty across the globe, visited Twitter, and listened to other women speakers in tech. A very inspiring experience that helps close the gap with women in tech.

### Rails Girls
Full day conference / workshop to teach women of all experience levels (beginner to intermediate) how to do Ruby (a modern programming language), Ruby on Rails (rails is a web app framework Ruby runs on), Twitter Bootstrap (a front-end framework that makes websites pretty), Git/GitHub (a version control system that tracks all your code history), and basic Unix commands (for being a hax0rz in terminal / command line). Free. I had fun. Inspired me to do web apps at one point!


### Y Combinator / Female Founders Conference 
Y Combinator is an accelerator that funds students / people attempting to found their own startups/companies. I have never attended the Female Founders conference, but it’s more entrepreneurial in nature. They have videos from all past years.

### Millennium Girls
For 5th-8th grade girls

### Education, Diversity, Information, Technology (EDIT)
For high schoolers

## Groups

### Ladies Storm Hackathons Facebook Group
An amazing women in tech FB group where people have critical discussions about tech, share advice, help each other with job searching, salary negotiations, connecting people at other companies. They are a tight-knit group that really helps people across the nation. They also have a wonderful LSH Medium collection (a lot of the girls there are also previous Code Campers) and you can get a glimpse of life in tech and what we’re doing to make it better.

## Hackathons

### Major League Hacking (MLH)
Hackathons are 24-36 hour real-live tech fairs/programming competitions/learning-mentorship opportunities where students across a nation gather with mentors and professionals to learn new skills, build any idea from scratch, and get fed food all weekend and make friends. I know there’s a CalHacks. My friend studied CS/Bio and was Director of PennApps for a few years before graduating. She really helped push applying CS to health/wellness initiatives there. PennApps does travel reimbursement and is a bi-annual hackathon. Tons of other great ones out there to learn from!

### Hackcon
I was a hackathon organizer in college, I founded RedbirdHacks at my university. Hackcon is sponsored by MLH for hackathon organizers across the country to gather, exchange stories/ideas, and learn about the direction of tech. They provide room and food accommodations for the weekend. Hackathon organizers highlight the more entrepreneurial, logistical side of tech. People like me that love to plan things usually show up here.

# Studies

## Majors

* Computer Science
* Software Engineering
* Electrical Engineering
* Mechanical Engineering
* Security
* Information Technology

## Courses

If you have a degree already or are not ready to pursue a university degree in a technical field, you can supplement your education by taking online courses for experience, "nano" degrees, portfolio building, or as an introduction to a field you might be interested in.

* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/all) - A good immediate introduction to programming for people with zero experience.
* [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree) - Structured courses that can be for both beginners to intermediate developers with the potential to earn a nano degree.
* Udemy - 
* Stanford Online - 

## Coding Bootcamps

Recommended for people who did not study Computer Science or an equivalent technical degree while in college. Many non-traditoinal students attend coding bootcamps and successfully land junior developer/engineering jobs in tech shortly after.

  * This article highlights the complexities of doing simple interactions with computers we take for granted.
  * It highlights the several layers and complexities involved in technology and is reflected in the many collaborators with varying expertise that contributed to it.
  * You will not understand ALL of it (and even people with four year CS degress likely will not either) because technology is such a broad field. Just enjoy reading and being exposed to the breadth of technical knowledge out there (frontend, web, backend, hardware)
