* [Cracking The Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Edition/dp/0984782850)
* Women Who Choose Computer Science – What Really Matters (Google Research) - One of my favorite research articles highlighting factors that may potentially contribute to the lack of women in CS / STEM in general. Very insightful.

### State Farm Internships
Obligatory, this is where it all started for me / that’s my face on the website lol

## Events

### Google's Women Techmakers

> From 2014 to present, Women Techmakers is continually launching global scalable initiatives and piloting new programs to support and empower women in the industry.

#### Rachel's Testimonial
When I went, it connected me to tons of women like me to lean on as friends and a professional network. We met Jack Dorsey and got to ask him questions, did machine learning/security workshops, participated in hackathons that applied our skills to helping a non-profit organization that pulls children out of poverty across the globe, visited Twitter, and listened to other women speakers in tech. A very inspiring experience that helps close the gap with women in tech.

### Rails Girls
Full day conference / workshop to teach women of all experience levels (beginner to intermediate) how to do Ruby (a modern programming language), Ruby on Rails (rails is a web app framework Ruby runs on), Twitter Bootstrap (a front-end framework that makes websites pretty), Git/GitHub (a version control system that tracks all your code history), and basic Unix commands (for being a hax0rz in terminal / command line). Free. I had fun. Inspired me to do web apps at one point!


### Y Combinator / Female Founders Conference 
Y Combinator is an accelerator that funds students / people attempting to found their own startups/companies. I have never attended the Female Founders conference, but it’s more entrepreneurial in nature. They have videos from all past years.

### Millennium Girls
For 5th-8th grade girls

### Education, Diversity, Information, Technology (EDIT)
For high schoolers

## Groups

### Ladies Storm Hackathons Facebook Group
An amazing women in tech FB group where people have critical discussions about tech, share advice, help each other with job searching, salary negotiations, connecting people at other companies. They are a tight-knit group that really helps people across the nation. They also have a wonderful LSH Medium collection (a lot of the girls there are also previous Code Campers) and you can get a glimpse of life in tech and what we’re doing to make it better.

## Hackathons

### Major League Hacking (MLH)
Hackathons are 24-36 hour real-live tech fairs/programming competitions/learning-mentorship opportunities where students across a nation gather with mentors and professionals to learn new skills, build any idea from scratch, and get fed food all weekend and make friends. I know there’s a CalHacks. My friend studied CS/Bio and was Director of PennApps for a few years before graduating. She really helped push applying CS to health/wellness initiatives there. PennApps does travel reimbursement and is a bi-annual hackathon. Tons of other great ones out there to learn from!

### Hackcon
I was a hackathon organizer in college, I founded RedbirdHacks at my university. Hackcon is sponsored by MLH for hackathon organizers across the country to gather, exchange stories/ideas, and learn about the direction of tech. They provide room and food accommodations for the weekend. Hackathon organizers highlight the more entrepreneurial, logistical side of tech. People like me that love to plan things usually show up here.
